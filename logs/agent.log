Timestamp: 2026-02-01T11:41:52.380328

Issue Detected:
  Detected ICICI failure spike (33.33%)

Reasoning:
  Based on 12 transactions, ICICI showing 33.33% failure rate (baseline: 5.0%). 4 transactions failed. This degradation has persisted across 166 observation windows (110 minutes). Severity: HIGH.

Proposed Action:
  CRITICAL: Temporarily route ICICI traffic to backup banks

Confidence Level: 95%
Risk Assessment: high
